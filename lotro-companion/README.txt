This is the readme/install/faq document for LOTRO Companion.

Note:
English is not my mother-tongue, so I apologize if this document contains some weird/meaningless sentences!
Let me know so that I can fix this document in future releases.

0. INSTALLATION
===============
Unzip the lotro-companion-N.P.zip to somewhere on your hard-drive.

1. RUNNING LOTRO COMPANION
==========================
LOTRO Companion shall run on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
LOTRO Companion runs with Java. So you'll need a JRE.
In the Windows distribution, a 64bit Java 8 runtime (OpenJDK) is provided.
The "import from client" feature will only work with a local LOTRO client for windows, and it needs admin rights.

1.1 Windows
-----------
Run the "LotRO Companion.exe" file.

1.2 Linux
---------
Set the executable flag on the LotroCompanion.sh file, if needed.
Run the companion.sh file to launch LOTRO Companion.

1.3 Internet connection
-----------------------
This version of LOTRO Companion does not require an Internet connection.
If you have one, it will check for available software updates on startup.

2. UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION
====================================

2.1 FROM A VERSION <= 4.x
-------------------------
Unzip the new version in its own directory.
Copy or move all the files/directories "characters" and "preferences" of the "data" directory of the old installation to the directory ".lotrocompanion/data" of your "user" directory.

Then run LOTRO Companion. You'll get back all the toons you had previously.

my.lotro.com has been discontinued so the old features such as 'character log', 'levelling', 'crafting history' and 'warbands'
won't be able to download the updated character data.
It is now possible (since 6.0) to edit these data (reputation, levels, crafting).
With version 8.0, it is possible to edit deeds status.
But the character log and the warbands statistics will be useless for new users.

3. MISC/FAQ
===========
3.1 Known issues
----------------
3.1.1 Items
-----------
The items database contains all items/icons for Update 34 (15/11/2022).
The application handles scalable items: set the item level to get the appropriate stats. Some items may have bugs.

3.1.2 Import
------------
It is possible that the import won't work anymore after an update of the Lotro Client.
In that case, I will try to publish an update/patch to fix that.

4. LICENSE
==========
See the LICENSE.TXT file in the doc directory of the distribution.
The licenses of the distributed libraries can be found in doc/licenses.
